This is because of their respective definitions. Closeness centrality adds distances in the denominator with a constant numerator of 1, so the resulting numbers are small and close to zero, which is hard to interpret. In contrast, assignment centrality adds the fractions together so that the result is larger and corresponds to a node with a higher value having a greater effect on centrality - this is more meaningful.**"

    "The next two questions require an implementation of Newman's agglomerative algorithm for community detection (see the hints at the end of these questions).  We met it in `topic3b.pdf`: it is described on Slide 4.  Recall that the algorithm finds many community decompositions.  It starts with the decomposition in which every node alone is a community, and then merges communities until the decomposition in which every node is in the same community is reached.  Thus the output to the algorithm contains a list of many decompositions. Also the algorithm calculates the change in the modularity $Q$ at each step so the relative value of $Q$ for each decomposition is part of the output.

Suggest how community finder could be used as the basis of a community decomposition algorithm (that, as usual, partitions the nodes into disjoint sets) and test your idea on the network of `zachary.txt`.  \n",

The values in the dictionary will record the nodes in the community and the number of endpoints incident with those nodes.\n",
