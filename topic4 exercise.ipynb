    "[5 marks] We consider a simple model of contagion where within a fixed population each individual has the same number of contacts and when infected transmits the disease to each with probability $p$.  Suppose that there is an outbreak of a contagious disease within this fixed population. You have been tasked with attempting to control the epidemic and have found two methods, but each has a cost. In the following all monetary units are in billions of pounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first method attempts to restrict contact between individuals: if you spend $x$, then each individual will come into contact with $40−x/2$ others.\n",
    "- The second method attempts to reduce the probability of transmission: if you spend $y$, then the probability of transmission upon contact is $0.04 − y/1000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a total of 20 billion pounds to spend and can implement both methods at once (that is, $x + y = 20$).  If your aim is to minimize the spread of the disease, what values should you choose for $x$ and $y$?  Explain your answer.\n",
