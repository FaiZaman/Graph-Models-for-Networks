# Graph Models for Networks

This repository experiments with the properties of different networks represented as graphs and implements algorithms dealing with these.

## Topic 1

Topic 1 involves clustering coefficients, preferential attachment models, and C graphs.

## Topic 2

Topic 2 involves Kleinberg models, searchable networks, and search time.

## Topic 3

Topic 3 deals with centrality measures and their effectiveness and impact, communities, Newman's agglomerative algorithm for community detection, and community finder algorithms.
